Dependencies
============

The core of pymontecarlo requires the following libraries:

  - numpy
  - h5py
  - pyparsing

Setting pymontecarlo for development
====================================

pymontecarlo uses setuptools' entry points to discover installed Monte Carlo
programs. To allow the development of both the core and the programs, 
the **develop** command must be run on all ``setup.py`` files. This adds
a link inside your local Python site-packages to the development pymontecarlo
folder. To simplify running all ``setup.py`` files, a *paver* script was 
written.

1. Install paver::

  pip install paver
  
2. Go in the root directory of pymontecarlo project

3. Rename ``pavement.cfg.example`` to ``pavement.cfg`` and edit the file to add
   the absolute path to the other projects

4. Run::

  paver develop
